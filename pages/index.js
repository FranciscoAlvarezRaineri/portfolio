          After a decade of part-time and temporary jobs, I felt the need to
          settle down and follow the path of a professional career. <br />
          Programming came as the obvious choice. The subject caught my
          attention back in high-school because problem solving is my passion
          and writing comes as a natural way to achieve it.
          <br /> Having graduated from an +800hs intensive bootcamp, Iâ€™m eager
          to join a team and start adding value.
          <br /> Meanwhile, there are plenty of problems to work on and tools to
          learn.
