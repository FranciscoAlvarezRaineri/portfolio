            After a decade of part-time and temporary jobs, I felt the need to
            settle down and follow the path of a professional career. <br />
            Programming came as the obvious choice. The subject caught my
            attention back in high-school because problem solving is my passion
            and writing comes as a natural way to achieve it.
            <br /> Having graduated from an +800hs intensive bootcamp, Iâ€™m eager
            to join a team and start adding value.
            <br /> Meanwhile, there are plenty of problems to work on and tools
            to learn.
